An unofficial, community-driven **Assault Fire PH** preservation and server-emulation project.

The goal is simple: make the retired PH client usable in a local/isolated environment for preservation, interoperability, research, and nostalgia.

## What works today

The current public baseline is **v143b**.

- VERSION / AUTH / DIR / ROLE / ZONE local backend flow
- existing/local profile login path
- dynamic PvE room and dedicated-server lifecycle with stock-selected map support
- lazy AFDEV startup instead of spawning a server when a lobby is merely created
- v48 AFDEV loader + v9 multi-peer UDP bridge
- zero-DSKey readiness gate before the UE3 session is released

The first-time nickname/new-account flow and several social/progression features are still separate work. See **[Project Status](docs/STATUS.md)** for the detailed matrix.

## Important: legacy kernel anti-cheat

Before troubleshooting the emulator, make sure the original PH client's **legacy kernel anti-cheat / security driver is not blocking the client from starting correctly**.

This component was built for an older Windows environment and can cause crashes, driver initialization failures, or startup problems on modern systems before the emulator is ever contacted.

This project does **not** provide bypass, disabling, kernel-modification, or security-circumvention instructions.

**Diagnostic hint:** if the client fails before you see normal VERSION / AUTH traffic in the emulator logs, or Windows/client messages point to a driver/security initialization problem, you are still dealing with the **client/OS compatibility layer**, not a server-protocol bug. Resolve that environment compatibility independently in an isolated preservation setup before debugging the emulator.

See **[Vital Setup Notes](docs/VITAL_SETUP_NOTES.md)** and **[Issue #4](https://github.com/armangido/af-emulator/issues/4)** for the known symptoms and project scope.

## Quick start

### 1. Clone and install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/armangido/af-emulator.git
cd af-emulator

py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Generate the local RSA key

Point the helper at your own Assault Fire PH `TCLS\config` directory:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\tools\setup\generate_local_rsa_keypair.py --client-config-dir "D:\YourAssaultFireFolder\TCLS\config"
```

This creates the local server key and matching `APClient.dat`.

**Never commit or upload `server\PRIVATE.PEM`.**

### 3. Check TCLS raw-PEM compatibility

Before launching, verify the exact `TCLS.dll` that your client uses:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\tools\patches\diagnose_tcls_apclient.py --client-root "D:\YourAssaultFireFolder"
```

For the known PH build, the diagnostic will identify one of these states:

```text
13EAD403452E0F25CF00658369BF4BF5FF34ED1B16027F7833FB27D398386CD1
  -> original/pre-patch TCLS; raw APClient.dat compatibility patch is required

3FF351E0ADB594D7544E28DB2E966A6D6EB548E9DF70DAAF4DAF58F2EE438D56
  -> verified patched TCLS; no APClient loader patch is needed
```

If the original `13EAD403...` build is detected, fully close `client.exe` / TCLS and run:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\tools\patches\patch_tcls_apclient_raw_pem.py "D:\YourAssaultFireFolder\TCLS\Tenio\TCLS.dll" --apply
```

The helper verifies the exact source hash and instruction bytes, creates `TCLS.dll.bak`, applies only the recovered compatibility edits, and requires the final DLL hash to match the verified working build. **Do not force this patch onto an unknown TCLS hash.**

This step is important when the launcher shows **`AP client initialization failed.`** even though `PRIVATE.PEM` and `APClient.dat` already match.

### 4. Redirect the retired PH services to localhost

Run from **Administrator PowerShell**:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\setup\setup_assaultfire_hosts.ps1
```

### 5. Start the emulator

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\server\assaultfire_server_v143b.py
```

For **PvE**, point `AF_GAME_DIR` at the `Binaries\\Win32` directory inside your own Assault Fire PH installation before starting the server. The drive letter and install location do not matter:

```powershell
$env:AF_GAME_DIR = "<full path to your Assault Fire PH Binaries\Win32 folder>"
$env:AF_DS_SPAWNER_ENABLED = "1"
```

The repository does **not** provide `TGame_AFDEV.exe`, maps, packages, or other original game files.

### 6. Launch the PH client

For the validated PH build, use **one** compatibility path:

**Normal TCLS launch**

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\tools\patches\patch_tgame_datetime.py
```

Then launch normally through `client.exe / TCLS`.

**Suspended TCLS handoff**

Log in through TCLS and stop at the normal **START** screen, then run:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\tools\patches\patch_tcls_suspended_launch.py
```

The suspended-launch helper already applies the datetime compatibility patch, so **do not run both helpers for the same launch**.

For the full walkthrough, use **[Getting Started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)**.

## PvE maps

The stable PvE path is integrated on `main` and is map-generic. The stock room selection is carried into the lazy AFDEV startup, so supported PvE maps use the same dedicated-server lifecycle.

```text
Create room
   ↓
reserve DS capacity only
   ↓
Start Match
   ↓
arm per-room bridge + return DS assignment
   ↓
first valid client DS UDP packet
   ↓
lazy-start v48 AFDEV
   ↓
verify world / movement / zero DS key
   ↓
SESSION_READY
   ↓
release latched packet through v9 bridge
   ↓
UE3 gameplay session
```

Room settings sent through A11E are applied before the lazy AFDEV spawn, including the selected map, mode, submode/difficulty, and flags.

A PH-client HUD label can still display the wrong text in some cases; that is tracked separately from the authoritative server/AFDEV difficulty state.

See **[PvE Runtime](docs/PVE_RUNTIME.md)** for implementation details.

## If something fails

Start with the symptom instead of changing random files:

- **`AP client initialization failed.`** → repeat Quick start step 3 and confirm the loaded TCLS hash; see [Launcher / AP / TGame errors](docs/LAUNCHER_ERRORS.md) and [Issue #7](https://github.com/armangido/af-emulator/issues/7).
- **TCLS launches but TGame does not hand off correctly** → [Vital Launch Requirements](docs/LAUNCH_REQUIREMENTS.md)
- **TGame crashes around datetime/startup** → use one of the compatibility helpers above
- **legacy security-driver / modern Windows startup problems** → [Vital Setup Notes](docs/VITAL_SETUP_NOTES.md) and [Issue #4](https://github.com/armangido/af-emulator/issues/4)
- **not sure whether a feature is implemented** → [Project Status](docs/STATUS.md)

When reporting a problem, include the exact error text and the last server/client log lines before the failure.
